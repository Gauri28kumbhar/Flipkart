  This project is aimed at building a Flipkart clone using HTML and CSS. The objective is to replicate the front-end of Flipkart, an e-commerce website, with a focus on designing a 
  responsive and user-friendly interface.

Key Features:
Homepage Layout: Display featured products, categories, and banners with modern design.
Navigation Bar: A sticky navbar with product categories (like electronics, fashion, home) and a search bar.
Product Listing Page: Grid layout for displaying product images, names, prices, and "Add to Cart" buttons.
Product Details Page: A detailed view of individual products including images, descriptions, and ratings.
Footer Section: Includes links to customer service, policies, and social media icons.

Project Steps:
HTML Structure: Create sections such as header, main content (products), and footer using semantic HTML tags (<header>, <section>, <footer>).
CSS Styling: Style the webpage using CSS, focusing on responsive design with Flexbox or Grid layout.
Responsive Design: Ensure the page adjusts well on different screen sizes (mobile, tablet, desktop) using media queries.
